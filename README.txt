The Modulation Filterbank Model Toolbox is a MATLAB Toolbox offering a modular framework for setting up simple auditory models inspired by the work of Torsten Dau (PEMO model). These models aim at predicting the processing of temporal and spectral cues by human listeners.

This toolbox uses the gammatone filterbank functions available at https://github.com/LeoVarnet/Hohmann_Gammatone. Other toolboxes are necessary to run certain options - see help.
